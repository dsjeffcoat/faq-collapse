          Why is your name Jaysen Dante?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          One day I was working on coming up with my pseudonym for my writing and just started with the simple approach of playing with my birth given name. Eventually I flipped my entire name around and that's how I played into making it Jaysen Dante.

          When did you get into programming?

        <p class="faq-text">
          I've always dabbled with web development and programming since my high school years, but it wasn't until 2015 when I started taking it seriously in order to build my personal branding as a freelancer.

          Why did you choose to change careers?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          I noticed during my previous job as a proposal writer and even prior to that while I was going for my Masters that we are currently going through a new evolution. A digital evolution in which almost everything that we consume and gather information-wise would be digitally. Because of this, I felt that I needed to make the transition and broaden my skills to include tech skills. This eventually made me fall in love with programming.

          What is your end goal?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          I would love to see myself working for some of the top companies out there and helping build solutions with their brands, but I also want to build solutions within the media space to help build it into a stronger platform for everyone as well as maintaining the ethics that a lot of media professionals vow to follow during their careers.
